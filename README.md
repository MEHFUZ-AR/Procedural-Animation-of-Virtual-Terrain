# Procedural-Animation-of-Virtual-Terrain
In this project, I have used procedural methods to generate a virtual terrain. Several important component of this project are already implemented which includes geometry (mesh generation, procedural height generation), rendering (terrain shading, texturing) and animation (camera animation). Besides this I have implemented some advanced features for this project which includes but not limited to displacement map to animate waves; the map was computed numerically as a sum of periodic functions varying over time. I have also used use the normal map texture (water.png) to represent waves that involves overlapping multiple scaled copies of this texture and translate them over time to emulate a water effect. The clouds in the scene was also animated using a periodic function over time. Moreover, I have implementedFractal Brownian Motion. A glossy component utilizing the reflection component of the water normal and up vector was applied to the water that changes according to camera viewpoint. The camera motion in the animation can be controlled using WASD keys and mouse. For directly running the animation go to build/Terrains/Release/ and run the Terrains api.
